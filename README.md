# vue_ebbix_sample

This is the Ebbix-technology's sample [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/) based CRUD app.

Other tools that are used are:

- vue-router [Vue Router](https://router.vuejs.org/).
- axios [Axios](https://www.axios.com/).
- vue unit testing [Vue Test Utils](https://vue-test-utils.vuejs.org/) (we also added e2e testing library)
- visual testing [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/),

yarn install
```

### Component Development With Storybook
